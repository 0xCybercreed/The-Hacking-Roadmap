x02_Hacker
* Understands the OWASP Top 10 and probably recently learned about CORS, OOB-XXE, JWT bugs, Cache Poisoning, OAuth2, and NoSQL Databases.
* Can do basic code review, but will likely struggle to find more granular vulnerabilities that require fuzzing and advanced debugging.
* Can build basic tools with Sockets, Regular Expressions, Web Scrapping Libraries, etc.

* Might get stumped when trying to bypass certain protections such as firewalls, Content Security Policy, etc.
* If this is true for you then go ahead this section is for you.
